				<p>This post is to document how I added desktop icons to my AwesomeWM rice and some of the hiccups I ran into.</p>
				<p>To start off, there are two file managers with built-in desktop icons: PCManFM and Nemo. I use Nemo and would recommend using it far more than PCManFM, mainly because Nemo uses gtk3 as opposed to gtk2 and is actively maintained. Nemo comes with the command <code>nemo-desktop</code>, more commonly known as Cinnamon's desktop -- however, it can be used on any window manager with a few tweaks.</p>
				<p>When running <code>nemo-desktop</code> initially, desktop icons will not appear and need to be enabled. To enable them run the following command:</p>
				<pre><code>gsettings set org.nemo.desktop show-desktop-icons true</code></pre>
				<p>For ease of use I suggest adding <code>nemo-desktop</code> to your window manager's autostart script. Additionally, <code>nemo-desktop</code> may not start due to the following line in <code>/usr/share/applications/nemo-autostart.desktop</code>, so you may need to remove it:</p>
				<pre><code>OnlyShowIn=X-Cinnamon;</code></pre>
				<p>Unlike most window managers, AwesomeWM treats clients like <code>nemo-desktop</code> as any other client. Because of this <code>nemo-desktop</code> will "occupy" tags, by default be confined to a single tag, and not be visible on others. To fix this I used the following hacks:</p>

<pre><code>screen.connect_signal("request::desktop_decoration", function(s)
	awful.tag({ "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", " " }, s, awful.layout.layouts[1])
end)</code></pre>

<pre><code>ruled.client.append_rule {
    id = "desktop",
    rule_any = {
        class = {
        "Nemo-desktop"
        }
    },
    properties = { sticky = true, tag = " " }
}</code></pre>

				<p>To avoid a tag appearing "occupied" I created another tag called <code>" "</code> exclusively for <code>nemo-desktop</code>. When using a taglist without a background or icons, like mine, it's unnoticeable. A rule is also added to make <code>nemo-desktop</code> sticky and therefore visible on all desktops.</p>
				<p>Lastly, your wallpaper may be hidden by <code>nemo-desktop</code> since it covers the root window. There are two options to fix this:</p>
				<li>Set your wallpaper through nemo. This is fine for a single rice setup but can make it more annoying to change your wallpaper.</li>
				<li>Make <code>nemo-desktop</code> transparent by making this element transparent in your gtk theme:</li>

<pre><code>notebook stack:only-child {
    background: transparent;
}</code></pre>

				<p>The only other thing to keep in mind is that <code>nemo-desktop</code> uses its own root menu, meaning that you won't be able to use your own root menu. This isn't a problem for me since I like the root menu and it integrates well with Nemo, but it may be different for you.</p>
				<p>It's really disappointing to me that most window managers don't really support desktop icons since they make a standard rice much closer to a desktop environment. Hopefully this post is comprehensive enough that it can help with adding them to your own rice.</p>
