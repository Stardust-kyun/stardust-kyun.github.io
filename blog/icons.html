					# Desktop Icons

					This post is to document how I added desktop icons to my AwesomeWM rice and some of the hiccups I ran into.

					To start off, there are two file managers with built-in desktop icons: PCManFM and Nemo. I use Nemo and would recommend using it far more than PCManFM, mainly because Nemo uses gtk3 as opposed to gtk2 and is actively maintained. Nemo comes with the command <code>nemo-desktop</code>, more commonly known as Cinnamon's desktop -- however, it can be used on any window manager with a few tweaks.

					When running <code>nemo-desktop</code> initially, desktop icons will not appear and need to be enabled. To enable them run the following command:
					<pre><code>gsettings set org.nemo.desktop show-desktop-icons true</code></pre>
					For ease of use I suggest adding <code>nemo-desktop</code> to your window manager's autostart script. Additionally, <code>nemo-desktop</code> may not start due to the following line in <code>/usr/share/applications/nemo-autostart.desktop</code>, so you may need to remove it:
					<pre><code>OnlyShowIn=X-Cinnamon;</code></pre>
					Unlike most window managers, AwesomeWM treats clients like <code>nemo-desktop</code> as any other client. Because of this <code>nemo-desktop</code> will "occupy" tags, by default be confined to a single tag, and not be visible on others. To fix this I used the following hacks:
	<pre><code>screen.connect_signal("request::desktop_decoration", function(s)
		awful.tag({ "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", " " }, s, awful.layout.layouts[1])
	end)</code></pre>
	<pre><code>ruled.client.append_rule {
		id = "desktop",
		rule_any = {
			class = {
			"Nemo-desktop"
			}
		},
		properties = { sticky = true, tag = " " }
	}</code></pre>
					To avoid a tag appearing "occupied" I created another tag called <code>" "</code> exclusively for <code>nemo-desktop</code>. When using a taglist without a background or icons, like mine, it's unnoticeable. A rule is also added to make <code>nemo-desktop</code> sticky and therefore visible on all desktops.

					Lastly, your wallpaper may be hidden by <code>nemo-desktop</code> since it covers the root window. There are two options to fix this:

					1. Set your wallpaper through nemo. This is fine for a single rice setup but can make it more annoying to change your wallpaper.
					2. Make <code>nemo-desktop</code> transparent by making this element transparent in your gtk theme:

	<pre><code>notebook stack:only-child {
		background: transparent;
	}</code></pre>

					The only other thing to keep in mind is that <code>nemo-desktop</code> uses its own root menu, meaning that you won't be able to use your own root menu. This isn't a problem for me since I like the root menu and it integrates well with Nemo, but it may be different for you.

					It's really disappointing to me that most window managers don't really support desktop icons since they make a standard rice much closer to a desktop environment. Hopefully this post is comprehensive enough that it can help with adding them to your own rice.
