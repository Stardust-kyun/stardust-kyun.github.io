				<p>This website took me around 3 hours to develop. It's a complete mess, but I think it works well enough. The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/stardust-kyun/stardust-kyun.github.io" class="link">here</a>.</p>
				<p>Honestly, HTML is pretty enjoyable to write with. It's nothing special, it works fairly well. Tags are a pain but I got used to it pretty quickly. I think I'll try some more web dev stuff in the future.</p>
				<p>For now, though, this will just be a simple website for some information about me and maybe the occasional short blog post. I'll see how it goes.</p>
				<br>
				<p>An update for the second time writing this website -- it's taken me closer to 10 hours to change everything to this new, much better layout. Very happy with how everything is looking and everything is coded much better.</p>
