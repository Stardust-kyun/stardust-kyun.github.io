						# First Post

						This website took me around 3 hours to develop. It's a complete mess, but I think it works well enough. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/stardust-kyun/stardust-kyun.github.io).

						Honestly, HTML is pretty enjoyable to write with. It's nothing special, it works fairly well. Tags are a pain but I got used to it pretty quickly. I think I'll try some more web dev stuff in the future.

						For now, though, this will just be a simple website for some information about me and maybe the occasional short blog post. I'll see how it goes.


						An update for the second time writing this website -- it's taken me closer to 10 hours to change everything to this new, much better layout. Very happy with how everything is looking and everything is coded much better.

						
						Third update -- I'm currently undergoing a massive layout rework; the backend is improving a lot from what it used to be and I now have much more advanced features (see: manga reviews page).
