						content="THE yuri manga. As of writing this, it's been a few years since I've read it, but I really enjoyed the story. Its characters feel alive, each having their own complex feelings that are explored in a way that makes the reader truly understand where they're coming from. Has a very satisfying ending and I highly recommend reading it, especially if you're new to yuri. 10/10"

						content="One of my all time favorites. Not exactly a single story; it's moreso a compilation of interconnected stories as each couple is given a few chapters to explore their relationship. It includes a wide variety of relationships, both romantic and platonic. None of them feel glossed over or rushed, and each is a great story on its own. What really makes this special to me is the overarching couple, which executes the idea of 'enemies to lovers' perfectly. Full of wonderful fluff and cuteness, give it a read! 10/10"

						content="Literally the definition of fluff. Adorable couples that show their love for one another clearly. While there is drama, none of it is the 'do they like me? can I trust them?' drama that so many stories have sunk into. Rather, the drama is caused by actual plot and not only requires the characters working together to overcome, but also makes the characters closer with every difficulty overcome. 10/10 
						<br><br>Translation is unfortunately behind; many chapters after 150 are either machine translated or are being translated slowly. Bato.to has the most new chapters in the official version, but a new translator named Hazazel has been pumping out chapters quick on Bato.to's non-official version and Mangadex. "

						content="Incredible manga. Insane, mindbending visuals and an excellent story which had me by the throat the entire read. Monster designs are some of the best I've ever seen, invoking both horror and a sense of awe. Somehow, the protagonist having a gun that deletes everything in front of it for 70-odd kilometers is actually pretty balanced. However, I think most of the quality of this manga comes from the settings it takes place in, which could even be considered the 'main character' -- most of the actual meat of the manga comes from panels with no dialogue or real story, but rather the incredible atmosphere of the environment. The best example of this is towards the end of the manga, where the protagonist walks through a 'room' (if you can even call it that) which is literally the size of Jupiter. Truly a megalophobe's worst nightmare. 10/10"
