					>THE yuri manga. As of writing this, it's been a few years since I've read it, but I really enjoyed the story. Its characters feel alive, each having their own complex feelings that are explored in a way that makes the reader truly understand where they're coming from. Has a very satisfying ending and I highly recommend reading it, especially if you're new to yuri.</manga-component>

					>One of my all time favorites. Not exactly a single story; it's moreso a compilation of interconnected stories as each couple is given a few chapters to explore their relationship. It includes a wide variety of relationships, both romantic and platonic. None of them feel glossed over or rushed, and each is a great story on its own. What really makes this special to me is the overarching couple, which executes the idea of "enemies to lovers" perfectly. Full of wonderful fluff and cuteness, give it a read!</manga-component>

					>Literally the definition of fluff. Adorable couples that show their love for one another clearly. While there is drama, none of it is the "do they like me? can I trust them?" drama that so many stories have sunk into. Rather, the drama is caused by actual plot and not only requires the characters working together to overcome, but also makes the characters closer with every difficulty overcome. 

						Translation is unfortunately very behind the raws. However, a new translator named Hazazel has been pumping out chapters quick on [Bato.to's non-official version](https://bato.to/series/192610/my-food-looks-very-cute) and [Mangadex](https://mangadex.org/title/b98c4daf-be1a-46c8-ad83-21d532995240/my-food-seems-to-be-very-cute). If they keep up their current pace, the translation should be caught up in around 2 months as of July 2025 (I doubt they'll keep the current pace though, it's way too much for one person).</manga-component>

					>Incredible manga. Insane, mindbending visuals and an excellent story which had me by the throat the entire read. Monster designs are some of the best I've ever seen, invoking both horror and a sense of awe. Somehow, the protagonist having a gun that deletes everything in front of it for 70-odd kilometers is actually pretty balanced. However, I think most of the quality of this manga comes from the settings it takes place in, which could even be considered the "main character" -- most of the actual meat of the manga comes from panels with no dialogue or real story, but rather the incredible atmosphere of the environment. The best example of this is towards the end of the manga, where the protagonist walks through a "room" (if you can even call it that) which is ***literally the size of Jupiter***. Truly a megalophobe's worst nightmare.</manga-component>

					>The true definition of fluff, in more ways than one! This is just a really nice comfort story... nothing too angsty or dramatic, just a story about a princess and her butler falling in love. It never feels "fake" in its characters or story and has a great sense of humor which peeks out occasionally. Overall a great pallete cleanser or just something to relax with.

						If you enjoyed this, check out its sequel oneshot [*Himesama to Watashi no Kekkon Ryokou*](https://mangadex.org/title/943cde7b-87bc-415d-b2b1-4b814eb6df04/my-honeymoon-with-the-princess).</manga-component>

					>This is an incredible manga with some of the strongest storytelling I've seen. One of the most compelling parts of its core story to me is the pairing of a beast girl and a blind girl -- it feels pretty reminiscent of queer struggles and how outsiders perceive a relationship they don't understand. If that's intentional, it's conveyed masterfully. The story is ripe with emotion and love in a way that hits you deeply, even more so once you come to the ending. That made me sob the first time I read it. I highly recommend this manga to pretty much anyone even slightly interested.</manga-component>

					>A surprisingly good coming to age story of learning about oneself and how to properly communicate with your partner. The main character is initially attached to the idea that homosexuality is unnatural or wrong, creating a lot of internal conflict as she cannot accept her own feelings and necessitating open communication with her partner. It's a pretty decent representation of internalized homophobia, more societal in nature than personal. I also really loved the art style, particularly in the little chibi character portraits which are adorable! The only issues I have with it largely have to do with the main characters being underage in more adult situations, but it's to be expected from a coming of age story.</manga-component>

					>Gorgeous art and a wonderful story. The story isn't particularly original, but the emotions in it are powerful and conveyed expertly. The art style is the highlight of this for me, it has a level of detail that isn't seen in many manga but it never feels overly detailed or visually crowded. Recommended for a short read.</manga-component>

					>A relatively short story that makes me tear up every time I read it. Such a simple story, but one of the best portrayals of love and loss I've ever seen. How you learn to love the little things, no matter how small. The pain of never experiencing them again. Just a gorgeous story. High recommendation if you're open to heavy stories about loss.</manga-component>

					>A super fluffy story with an airhead and a girl she mistook for a guy. While it takes a while for them to start properly communicating, their relationship is very healthy and fun to watch with minimal drama. Solid queer representation outside the main couple. If anything, I wish there was more of it! It kinda stops right around when the main characters get past their communication issues, which is a real shame because their dynamic would make for a wonderful slice of life story and they no doubt have more to overcome in the future in the form of parental approval. There are also very obvious hints at side character romances that never go anywhere. It almost makes me wonder if it got axed early. Overall a very sweet manga with a great story, I just wish it kept going.</manga-component>

					>An actually good take on the "will they won't they" trope. Everything feels believable as a natural progression of events rather than filler to draw out the story as these kinds often do. Very good representation of how societal attitudes towards queer people can be internalized by queer people themselves and the struggles that come with it. Namely the instinct to reject people automatically out of fear that you might get rejected based on differences in sexuality or other societal factors. Overall a great read.</manga-component>
