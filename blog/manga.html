						>THE yuri manga. As of writing this, it's been a few years since I've read it, but I really enjoyed the story. Its characters feel alive, each having their own complex feelings that are explored in a way that makes the reader truly understand where they're coming from. Has a very satisfying ending and I highly recommend reading it, especially if you're new to yuri.</manga-component>

						>One of my all time favorites. Not exactly a single story; it's moreso a compilation of interconnected stories as each couple is given a few chapters to explore their relationship. It includes a wide variety of relationships, both romantic and platonic. None of them feel glossed over or rushed, and each is a great story on its own. What really makes this special to me is the overarching couple, which executes the idea of "enemies to lovers" perfectly. Full of wonderful fluff and cuteness, give it a read!</manga-component>

						>Literally the definition of fluff. Adorable couples that show their love for one another clearly. While there is drama, none of it is the "do they like me? can I trust them?" drama that so many stories have sunk into. Rather, the drama is caused by actual plot and not only requires the characters working together to overcome, but also makes the characters closer with every difficulty overcome. 

						Translation is unfortunately very behind the raws. However, a new translator named Hazazel has been pumping out chapters quick on [Bato.to's non-official version](https://bato.to/series/192610/my-food-looks-very-cute) and [Mangadex](https://mangadex.org/title/b98c4daf-be1a-46c8-ad83-21d532995240/my-food-seems-to-be-very-cute). If they keep up their current pace, the translation should be caught up in around 2 months as of July 2025 (I doubt they'll keep the current pace though, it's way too much for one person).</manga-component>

						>Incredible manga. Insane, mindbending visuals and an excellent story which had me by the throat the entire read. Monster designs are some of the best I've ever seen, invoking both horror and a sense of awe. Somehow, the protagonist having a gun that deletes everything in front of it for 70-odd kilometers is actually pretty balanced. However, I think most of the quality of this manga comes from the settings it takes place in, which could even be considered the "main character" -- most of the actual meat of the manga comes from panels with no dialogue or real story, but rather the incredible atmosphere of the environment. The best example of this is towards the end of the manga, where the protagonist walks through a "room" (if you can even call it that) which is ***literally the size of Jupiter***. Truly a megalophobe's worst nightmare.</manga-component>

						>The true definition of fluff, in more ways than one! This is just a really nice comfort story... nothing too angsty or dramatic, just a story about a princess and her butler falling in love. It never feels "fake" in its characters or story and has a great sense of humor which peeks out occasionally. Overall a great pallete cleanser or just something to relax with.

						If you enjoyed this, check out its sequel oneshot [*Himesama to Watashi no Kekkon Ryokou*](https://mangadex.org/title/943cde7b-87bc-415d-b2b1-4b814eb6df04/my-honeymoon-with-the-princess).</manga-component>

						>This is an incredible manga with some of the strongest storytelling I've seen. One of the most compelling parts of its core story to me is the pairing of a beast girl and a blind girl -- it feels pretty reminiscent of queer struggles and how outsiders perceive a relationship they don't understand. If that's intentional, it's conveyed masterfully. The story is ripe with emotion and love in a way that hits you deeply, even more so once you come to the ending. That made me sob the first time I read it. I highly recommend this manga to pretty much anyone even slightly interested.</manga-component>

						>A surprisingly good coming to age story of learning about oneself and how to properly communicate with your partner. The main character is initially attached to the idea that homosexuality is unnatural or wrong, creating a lot of internal conflict as she cannot accept her own feelings and necessitating open communication with her partner. It's a pretty decent representation of internalized homophobia, more societal in nature than personal. I also really loved the art style, particularly in the little chibi character portraits which are adorable! The only issues I have with it largely have to do with the main characters being underage in more adult situations, but it's to be expected from a coming of age story.</manga-component>

High recommendation if you're open to heavy stories about loss.</manga-component>

						>A super fluffy story with an airhead and a girl she mistook for a guy. While it takes a while for them to start properly communicating, their relationship is very healthy and fun to watch with minimal drama. Solid queer representation outside the main couple. If anything, I wish there was more of it! It kinda stops right around when the main characters get past their communication issues, which is a real shame because their dynamic would make for a wonderful slice of life story and they no doubt have more to overcome in the future in the form of parental approval. There are also very obvious hints at side character romances that never go anywhere. It almost makes me wonder if it got axed early. Overall a very sweet manga with a great story, I just wish it kept going.</manga-component>

						>An actually good take on the "will they won't they" trope. Everything feels believable as a natural progression of events rather than filler to draw out the story as these kinds often do. Very good representation of how societal attitudes towards queer people can be internalized by queer people themselves and the struggles that come with it. Namely the instinct to reject people automatically out of fear that you might get rejected based on differences in sexuality or other societal factors. Overall a great read.</manga-component>

						>A ridiculously cute autobiography of an age gap couple which they write and draw together! It's packed with fluff and the art is superb. Mostly slice of life, though there are dedicated chapters to telling the story of how they got together and whatnot. The only thing holding this back for me is that I want to see more stories from them! The bite-sized slice of life is nice, but the art and storytelling truly shines in parts like the story of how they got together. Maybe this is addressed in future volumes.

						>This is a really special one for me. The first season of the anime was some of the first yuri I was exposed to, and it has a really strong charm to it. Fantastic comedy, great characters, and overall you can feel the amount of love the creators put into it. I think it has one of the strongest overarching stories for a slice of life manga I've seen, which is really being leaned into later in the series where it starts to take a more serious tone. It doesn't have much romance in it, but there is a very clear "main couple" (even if they aren't explicitly together) and the love characters have for one another is palpable, even if their words say otherwise. The only struggle I've had with it is the 4-koma layout, which is difficult to read on a phone, but once you get past that it's pretty smooth sailing.

						The author, Izumo Ito, has been struggling with health problems for a good portion of the manga's runtime, leading to substantial delays in chapters. As of writing, it's been over a year since the last chapter was released. However, [she posted on Twitter](https://xcancel.com/izumo_ito/status/1911073094418252087#m) in April that she's still alive and working on the manga, so we should hopefully see updates soon!</manga-component>

						>Truly one of the greatest yuri stories, hands down. It's fantastic at telling its story, especially with conveying its characters' emotions and motivations to the reader. The characters feel truly real and are very charming in their own ways. As for the story itself, it does an incredible job at showing the struggle of passion: not only how fulfilling it can be, but how draining it can be even to the point of quitting. It also shows some aspects of queer love that aren't touched on very often: namely, the idea that love is just not meant for you out of fear of rejection or self-hatred. Not only that, it does a great job of showing the difficulties in just accepting that you *can* be in love. By the end of the manga, you can truly see the change the characters have gone through, and it gives a very satisfying feeling. 

						Another really unique aspect is the setting and characters: an office environment with characters well into their adulthood. That isn't seen super often in yuri -- most focus heavily on romance and less on life itself -- but it really grounds the story from the beginning and treats it as a "story about life," less so a "story about love." I highly recommend giving it a read. 

						If you liked it, you should also check out its sequel oneshot [Still Life](https://mangadex.org/title/1b2f3e21-0991-4840-a47f-0f3026d7878a/still-life)!</manga-component>

						>A very sweet autobiography of the author and her girlfriend. While it's definitely slice of life, it's more story focused than most autobiographical manga are; rather than having short little tidbits from everyday life, it focuses much more on actual stories from the couple and their internal thoughts/feelings. The art style is pretty good -- it's a far more unique style than most, though it can definitely take some time to grow on you. I do wish it were a bit more varied in the kind of stories it tells though, as the lovey-dovey stories can get a bit samey after 30 chapters. It's oddly paradoxical: while it shows the reader a lot of their stories and how they think, by the end I still felt like I hadn't really gotten to know the characters as well as I should have. Regardless, it's a very sweet story from a real couple. The stereotypical lesbian pacing is also hilarious (ch. 20 pg. 1).</manga-component>

						>Can this even be called yuri bait when it's straight? While it doesn't have the most original story basis, this one is fantastic for what it is: a love story between a girl and the most androgynous person ever. Notions of "boyfriend" and "girlfriend," "guy" and "girl" are very fluid in this one -- and not only in our androgynous character. It's this fluidity that makes me feel, despite the main boy seeing themselves as a man (debatably), it reads very much like the story of a nonbinary person learning to accept themselves and finding a partner who accepts them for who they are too. The writing is great too; none of the characters really feel like shallow representations of stereotypes, which is difficult to pull off with subject matter like this. I really just wish that there was more of it!! After they get together there's like... 10 chapters left, it's ridiculous! I want 100! Give me more!</manga-component>

						>Right, so this one is actually really interesting. It initially starts off with the boring, done to death trope of a voiceless, faceless male protagonist and a female protagonist that just repeats their words. It's annoying, it sucks. But as time goes on... the male mc makes his first real appearance in chapter 15, *gets his first real dialogue in chapter 19,* ***gets eyes in chapter 27...*** it slowly morphs from generic slop to a genuine story with real, developed characters. While the male mc doesn't get the most attention, he still feels like an actual person unlike so many other self-insert shells. The real highlight of this story is the female mc who is fucking adorable. The art plays a massive part in this, giving her really fantastic expressions that just show her character so well... literally the most down bad girl I've seen in a manga in the best way. The two main characters make an adorable couple, and their dynamic is honestly worth the slog of the first 30 chapters. The story isn't complex at all, there's barely a pretense for why they fall for each other, but it turns out great.</manga-component>

						>The best slice of life ever. Hands down. Bar none. It doesn't get any better than this. 

						I think the core of what this manga does so well is the way that it utilizes space. So many manga, slice of life or otherwise, feel this need to constantly have *something* going on, whether it's dialogue or action or what have you. But here, I'd say a good portion of this manga -- easily 25% of it -- is solely made up of quiet shots and interactions with minimal to no dialogue at all. It has this calming presence to it which is really hard to convey, but it pulls it off perfectly. I don't think there even is a more relaxing manga than this one. The art is also absolutely phenomenal, easily some of the best I've ever seen. Not because of its detail, but just how believable it all is. It's hard to properly explain, but it feels much closer to the style of real people while maintaining the manga style and not looking disconcerting. 

						It's a very comfortable story. There are ups and downs, everybody has their own worries... I mean, that's life. The romance is a bit discreet at first, with the only truly explicit romance showing up at the very end, but you can definitely see the love from the very beginning. I really just wish that there was more story and romance after the end! The girls' romance stories are just getting started at the end, and there are hints towards where it could have gone in the omake... I would ***die*** for a sequel. Even just a oneshot. The best way I can describe this manga is with a single word: comfortable. It's the best of the best for a reason. Give it a read.

						The biggest shame is that this author has written very few other works. There is a prequel/pilot for Our Wonderful Days called [The Other Side of a Blank Page](https://mangadex.org/title/f1cb8ebf-d00d-4a49-9eb0-1b70bf5e39bf/the-other-side-of-a-blank-page), and a oneshot in the Syrup Yuri Anthology which I can't find. If the author ever makes another work, I will die happy.</manga-component>

						>One of the best story-focused yuri that still has some romance in it. The world building is incredibly well thought out with tons of cool details you'll notice on a second read through. The story is super engaging throughout and I never really felt my attention slipping; there were a few parts that felt slightly rushed or hand-wavey but with 100+ chapters that's to be expected at some point or another. Still tons of great mysteries, can't wait to see where the story goes in that regard. There are some serious flashback sections that allude to **(TW)** ||child abuse, murder, child sexual abuse, child death|| but it handled it really well and didn't give me whiplash like other stories have; it worked its way up to the reveal and nothing really feels out of place. I really enjoyed this one and can't wait to see where the story goes. Plus it had a crossover with the best manhua!</manga-component>

						>Absolutely adorable manhua from the authors of Straight Girl Trap! This one has a really fun concept which I don't see often, which is really leaning into the "demon" aspect of characters trying to integrate into human society, but with the twist of the love interest being a significantly more high ranking demon than the main character. The characters bounce off one another super well and the dynamics are really fun to watch, especially as they shift over time. The art is also some of the cutest I've seen, it's a real step up from their previous work in terms of cute factor! Especially chibi Tang Ran, she makes my heart melt. 

						The cameos from different series/authors are especially cool in this. Chapter 0.1 has an awesome sequence where the main character of this manhua is walking through a city and passing by the main couples from various other popular GL manhua! And then she meets with her love interest in this sort of, "we got a new story on the block! it's gonna be the same quality as the greats!" way! References and collabs are peppered throughout the rest of the story, and it's really awesome seeing cameos or references to other manhua I'm reading at the same time. Of course, the most seen cameo is the goat My Food Looks Very Cute. The authors even did a collab in a recent chapter where the author of My Food Looks Very Cute drew some bears for the story since the authors of this manhua aren't experienced with furry art (and our goat clearly is, lol). 

						I just love this one and I'm excited to see where it goes.</manga-component>

						>Actual peak. The highlight has gotta be the art style, which is adorable as hell, and the super expressive character interactions and dynamics. Kawa-chan and Pyon-chan are so cute with each other and the side characters all have their own charm; none (except for like one or two) feel looked over. The story is pretty compelling and I can't wait to see where it goes in the future, especially with some of the most recent developments that have really added depth to the character dynamics in play. Most of all I just want to see more adorableness between our two lovebirds! Especially after that kiss threw a wrench into the established rules...

						Unfortunately, the future of Garuru Girl is a bit up in the air. It hasn't received enough attention from a Japanese audience to have a very long runtime, and it's unclear if it will receive more than 3 volumes. As of writing, it seems likely that volume 3 will be the final volume and there will be ~5 more chapters at most. As is, the story feels like it's beginning to tie up some loose ends (though not coming to a conclusion yet). Which is such a shame, I want to see more of these characters!! They're so cute! 

						I feel like even if this ends at volume 3, it'll be one of my all time favorites. I highly recommend this one.</manga-component>

						>A fairly wholesome age gap relationship between a student and office worker. There isn't a whole lot in terms of an overarching story for this one; instead, it leans much more into the slice of life genre with short little vignettes in each chapter. The art is pretty cute and the dynamic between the main couple is enjoyable, but there isn't too much more compelling than that. It's a nice read.</manga-component>

						>God I love this one. Just from a technical standpoint, the art is really good and I love the character designs, both in style and personality. However, the story is where this manga really shines. It has a pretty cliche basis -- "what if we pretend dated to experience love?" -- but the emotional maturity of the characters is what makes it unique. Instead of resulting in tons of drama where the characters can't be honest about their feelings, and it all feels drawn out for no reason, the choices each character makes feel well thought out and make sense for who's making them, regardless of if they're wholly logical or not. It's a great story of these girls learning about themselves and who they are, helped by the other whether that's intentionally or not. They clearly love each other and make for a funny couple. I especially love how much of a (in Nagi's words) degenerate Manatsu can be, like she is so down bad for Nagi and it shows so much. Love their dynamic, can't wait to see where the story goes especially after chapter 10. I ironically just wish it were a bit more drawn out because as-is it feels like it's going way too fast!</manga-component>

There isn't a whole lot going on but it's a very enjoyable read for one sitting. The only reason why I don't rate it higher is because there isn't a whole lot of it; if there were more story or chapters it would be much higher. It feels like a 7.8 for me, not quite an 8 but much better than a 7.</manga-component>

						>Pretty standard cliche of "wait... the boy who asked me out as a kid was a girl??" but it goes in a pretty fun direction. I have a feeling that the original was intended to be a oneshot, then covid hit and the story moved more towards that direction to set up the romance. I guess it just wasn't compelling enough alone since it got axed pretty quickly and forced to wrap up in a chapter. Still a pretty good read. </manga-component>

It depicts the sort of social anxiety that comes with that kind of situation really accurately, especially with how long it can take to open up to people again. The art is really cute and the two main characters have a really nice dynamic of the more energetic, outgoing type and a more reserved and shy type. Basically yapper and listener, lol.</manga-component>

						>I'm obviously going to be biased on this one, being a craftsman myself, but this manga is ridiculously good. Not only is the art great and the story solid, but the information in it about coppersmithing is well researched and genuinely cared for. This is one of if not the best "artisan manga" I've read in terms of information quality. It also touches on different industries and histories for all kinds of topics! This is actual gold for any artisan who is also into manga. In terms of the story, it definitely doesn't take a backseat to the information; both aspects of the content feel balanced well and neither is given more weight than the other. All of the characters are charming and unique; none of them feel like stereotype sit-ins or copy/pasted templates, but rather genuine people with real lives. And of course, the dynamic between Shuu and Shiina. They are so adorable together. Like really, one of the best couples I've seen. This especially seeps into the rest of the story/industry aspects, where you can really see them maturing into the next generation of the industry which is *so satisfying.* I love the overarching generational themes, which are especially apparent with the references to each generation of craftsmen having their own focus, each generation of head clerks contributing to the business's products and identity in their own way. It's so, so good, and is one of my highest recommendations.

						Also, Shiina wears KMNZ merch! Peak recognizes peak.</manga-component>

						>I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this manga. The art is adorable, I love the characters, the story is cute... but there are a few oddities. Namely the gross goblins and orcs. Some sexualization of characters. It puts me off for some parts of the story. It also appears to have been axed? Maybe? As far as I'm aware, it hasn't received any updates for over a year by now, and it doesn't appear to be completed, but hasn't been officially cancelled either. Regardless, I really like the story concept (despite not being the most original) and the characters, it just feels incomplete and not very fleshed out. By my count there are only like 3 real sections of the story that go for a few chapters each. It's a shame, but I enjoyed it for what it is.</manga-component>

						>A good story about societal pressures surrounding being queer and coming out in general. The art style can definitely take some getting used to, but overall it's great. As with many romance stories, I just wish there was more story after the couple actually gets together! There's clearly a lot going on between them, but it just ends. The aggressive, pursuing junior is such a fun dynamic and Ayaka pulls it off really well. In general it's a great story for what it is, but it could be so much more.</manga-component>

						>This is a tough one to rate. Its concept is... alright, the "love rival who isn't a rival but actually is head over heels for the protagonist" is compelling enough, but good lord the execution. It's not great. The story starts out around a 7/10, pretty good but nothing special. It dips to a 6/10 for the majority of its runtime because it's just. The same shit over and over and over. There are only so many ways you can do the bait and switch of "wow, you seriously think you have a chance with him? How pathetic, you should know that you only have a chance **with me!!!**" especially if you're already expecting it because of the past 20 chapters or so. The final volume jumps up to an 8/10 and is actually pretty damn enjoyable, it's just a complete slog getting there. I'm not really sure if I can recommend this one, but it does have its moments.</manga-component>

						>A really strong story about friends turned rivals turned lovers. The dynamic between our two main characters is really fun, especially as Shen subtly messes with Jiang to make her realize her feelings. Jiang is also such a good autistic-coded character; she doesn't feel like a stereotype in the slightest and it actually plays a lot into her character. The side "couple" is also pretty enjoyable to watch, though it's far less romantic and more S/M focused. Overall it's a super solid story with great characters and art, it doesn't do the shitty thing and end as soon as the couple gets together and it actually shows them grow together as a couple. I always wnjoy coming back to this one and definitely recommend it.</manga-component>

						>I'm struggling to write my thoughts on this one, especially without spoilers. This is a very good story. I enjoyed it a lot, and from a literary standpoint it's incredibly strong. The big turn off for a lot of people: it's an incest story. In my eyes, it's a story about broken sisters beginning to actually live their lives with support from one another; it's just that support comes in the form of codependency and incest. And in this case, I think the incest actually helps from a story building perspective. The sisters never go beyond kissing, and I truly believe it to be less romantic love and more a codependency formed to support one another in the aftermath of their parents' divorce. They truly care about one another and are the most important person to each other, which I think is kind of the point of the whole manga. The ending lines are specifically addressing the question of "does it matter if we see one another as sisters or lovers, or just that we can live with the one we love the most?" It challenges the idea that your most important person must be a lover and can't be something else to you, like your sibling. The lines are blurring between the societal expectation that your number one is your lover, but your lover can't be your sibling. It's  a difficult and at times uncomfortable topic to discuss and I think it pulls it off really well. I'm sure I butchered my take so if you're interested in discussing, feel free to contact me. I'd love to hear what you think about it. I don't know if I can recommend this story to anyone, but I really appreciate it and find a lot of value in it. </manga-component>

						>So cute. So so cute. It's literally the title, but the dynamic between our adorable idiots works so well. I loved watching Kumada progressively became more and more conscious of Sayaka as he developed feelings for her, and the eventual confession... absolute gold. Totally recommend for a short and sweet story. I just wish we got a chapter where they get married! They talk about it so much and it sucks to never get that payoff. I also wish we could've seen more of Kumada's siblings and family interacting with Sayaka, but overall those are my only complaints. Love to come back to this one.</manga-component>
