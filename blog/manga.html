						>THE yuri manga. As of writing this, it's been a few years since I've read it, but I really enjoyed the story. Its characters feel alive, each having their own complex feelings that are explored in a way that makes the reader truly understand where they're coming from. Has a very satisfying ending and I highly recommend reading it, especially if you're new to yuri.</manga-component>

						>One of my all time favorites. Not exactly a single story; it's moreso a compilation of interconnected stories as each couple is given a few chapters to explore their relationship. It includes a wide variety of relationships, both romantic and platonic. None of them feel glossed over or rushed, and each is a great story on its own. What really makes this special to me is the overarching couple, which executes the idea of "enemies to lovers" perfectly. Full of wonderful fluff and cuteness, give it a read!</manga-component>

						>Literally the definition of fluff. Adorable couples that show their love for one another clearly. While there is drama, none of it is the "do they like me? can I trust them?" drama that so many stories have sunk into. Rather, the drama is caused by actual plot and not only requires the characters working together to overcome, but also makes the characters closer with every difficulty overcome. 

						Translation is unfortunately very behind the raws. However, a new translator named Hazazel has been pumping out chapters quick on [Bato.to's non-official version](https://bato.to/series/192610/my-food-looks-very-cute) and [Mangadex](https://mangadex.org/title/b98c4daf-be1a-46c8-ad83-21d532995240/my-food-seems-to-be-very-cute). If they keep up their current pace, the translation should be caught up in around 2 months as of July 2025 (I doubt they'll keep the current pace though, it's way too much for one person).</manga-component>

						>Incredible manga. Insane, mindbending visuals and an excellent story which had me by the throat the entire read. Monster designs are some of the best I've ever seen, invoking both horror and a sense of awe. Somehow, the protagonist having a gun that deletes everything in front of it for 70-odd kilometers is actually pretty balanced. However, I think most of the quality of this manga comes from the settings it takes place in, which could even be considered the "main character" -- most of the actual meat of the manga comes from panels with no dialogue or real story, but rather the incredible atmosphere of the environment. The best example of this is towards the end of the manga, where the protagonist walks through a "room" (if you can even call it that) which is ***literally the size of Jupiter***. Truly a megalophobe's worst nightmare.</manga-component>

						>The true definition of fluff, in more ways than one! This is just a really nice comfort story... nothing too angsty or dramatic, just a story about a princess and her butler falling in love. It never feels "fake" in its characters or story and has a great sense of humor which peeks out occasionally. Overall a great pallete cleanser or just something to relax with.

						If you enjoyed this, check out its sequel oneshot [*Himesama to Watashi no Kekkon Ryokou*](https://mangadex.org/title/943cde7b-87bc-415d-b2b1-4b814eb6df04/my-honeymoon-with-the-princess).</manga-component>

						>This is an incredible manga with some of the strongest storytelling I've seen. One of the most compelling parts of its core story to me is the pairing of a beast girl and a blind girl -- it feels pretty reminiscent of queer struggles and how outsiders perceive a relationship they don't understand. If that's intentional, it's conveyed masterfully. The story is ripe with emotion and love in a way that hits you deeply, even more so once you come to the ending. That made me sob the first time I read it. I highly recommend this manga to pretty much anyone even slightly interested.</manga-component>

						>A surprisingly good coming to age story of learning about oneself and how to properly communicate with your partner. The main character is initially attached to the idea that homosexuality is unnatural or wrong, creating a lot of internal conflict as she cannot accept her own feelings and necessitating open communication with her partner. It's a pretty decent representation of internalized homophobia, more societal in nature than personal. I also really loved the art style, particularly in the little chibi character portraits which are adorable! The only issues I have with it largely have to do with the main characters being underage in more adult situations, but it's to be expected from a coming of age story.</manga-component>

High recommendation if you're open to heavy stories about loss.</manga-component>

						>A super fluffy story with an airhead and a girl she mistook for a guy. While it takes a while for them to start properly communicating, their relationship is very healthy and fun to watch with minimal drama. Solid queer representation outside the main couple. If anything, I wish there was more of it! It kinda stops right around when the main characters get past their communication issues, which is a real shame because their dynamic would make for a wonderful slice of life story and they no doubt have more to overcome in the future in the form of parental approval. There are also very obvious hints at side character romances that never go anywhere. It almost makes me wonder if it got axed early. Overall a very sweet manga with a great story, I just wish it kept going.</manga-component>

						>An actually good take on the "will they won't they" trope. Everything feels believable as a natural progression of events rather than filler to draw out the story as these kinds often do. Very good representation of how societal attitudes towards queer people can be internalized by queer people themselves and the struggles that come with it. Namely the instinct to reject people automatically out of fear that you might get rejected based on differences in sexuality or other societal factors. Overall a great read.</manga-component>

						>A ridiculously cute autobiography of an age gap couple which they write and draw together! It's packed with fluff and the art is superb. Mostly slice of life, though there are dedicated chapters to telling the story of how they got together and whatnot. The only thing holding this back for me is that I want to see more stories from them! The bite-sized slice of life is nice, but the art and storytelling truly shines in parts like the story of how they got together. Maybe this is addressed in future volumes.

						>This is a really special one for me. The first season of the anime was some of the first yuri I was exposed to, and it has a really strong charm to it. Fantastic comedy, great characters, and overall you can feel the amount of love the creators put into it. I think it has one of the strongest overarching stories for a slice of life manga I've seen, which is really being leaned into later in the series where it starts to take a more serious tone. It doesn't have much romance in it, but there is a very clear "main couple" (even if they aren't explicitly together) and the love characters have for one another is palpable, even if their words say otherwise. The only struggle I've had with it is the 4-koma layout, which is difficult to read on a phone, but once you get past that it's pretty smooth sailing.

						The author, Izumo Ito, has been struggling with health problems for a good portion of the manga's runtime, leading to substantial delays in chapters. As of writing, it's been over a year since the last chapter was released. However, [she posted on Twitter](https://xcancel.com/izumo_ito/status/1911073094418252087#m) in April that she's still alive and working on the manga, so we should hopefully see updates soon!</manga-component>

						>Truly one of the greatest yuri stories, hands down. It's fantastic at telling its story, especially with conveying its characters' emotions and motivations to the reader. The characters feel truly real and are very charming in their own ways. As for the story itself, it does an incredible job at showing the struggle of passion: not only how fulfilling it can be, but how draining it can be even to the point of quitting. It also shows some aspects of queer love that aren't touched on very often: namely, the idea that love is just not meant for you out of fear of rejection or self-hatred. Not only that, it does a great job of showing the difficulties in just accepting that you *can* be in love. By the end of the manga, you can truly see the change the characters have gone through, and it gives a very satisfying feeling. 

						Another really unique aspect is the setting and characters: an office environment with characters well into their adulthood. That isn't seen super often in yuri -- most focus heavily on romance and less on life itself -- but it really grounds the story from the beginning and treats it as a "story about life," less so a "story about love." I highly recommend giving it a read. 

						If you liked it, you should also check out its sequel oneshot [Still Life](https://mangadex.org/title/1b2f3e21-0991-4840-a47f-0f3026d7878a/still-life)!</manga-component>

						>A very sweet autobiography of the author and her girlfriend. While it's definitely slice of life, it's more story focused than most autobiographical manga are; rather than having short little tidbits from everyday life, it focuses much more on actual stories from the couple and their internal thoughts/feelings. The art style is pretty good -- it's a far more unique style than most, though it can definitely take some time to grow on you. I do wish it were a bit more varied in the kind of stories it tells though, as the lovey-dovey stories can get a bit samey after 30 chapters. It's oddly paradoxical: while it shows the reader a lot of their stories and how they think, by the end I still felt like I hadn't really gotten to know the characters as well as I should have. Regardless, it's a very sweet story from a real couple. The stereotypical lesbian pacing is also hilarious (ch. 20 pg. 1).</manga-component>

						>Can this even be called yuri bait when it's straight? While it doesn't have the most original story basis, this one is fantastic for what it is: a love story between a girl and the most androgynous person ever. Notions of "boyfriend" and "girlfriend," "guy" and "girl" are very fluid in this one -- and not only in our androgynous character. It's this fluidity that makes me feel, despite the main boy seeing themselves as a man (debatably), it reads very much like the story of a nonbinary person learning to accept themselves and finding a partner who accepts them for who they are too. The writing is great too; none of the characters really feel like shallow representations of stereotypes, which is difficult to pull off with subject matter like this. I really just wish that there was more of it!! After they get together there's like... 10 chapters left, it's ridiculous! I want 100! Give me more!</manga-component>

						>Right, so this one is actually really interesting. It initially starts off with the boring, done to death trope of a voiceless, faceless male protagonist and a female protagonist that just repeats their words. It's annoying, it sucks. But as time goes on... the male mc makes his first real appearance in chapter 15, *gets his first real dialogue in chapter 19,* ***gets eyes in chapter 27...*** it slowly morphs from generic slop to a genuine story with real, developed characters. While the male mc doesn't get the most attention, he still feels like an actual person unlike so many other self-insert shells. The real highlight of this story is the female mc who is fucking adorable. The art plays a massive part in this, giving her really fantastic expressions that just show her character so well... literally the most down bad girl I've seen in a manga in the best way. The two main characters make an adorable couple, and their dynamic is honestly worth the slog of the first 30 chapters. The story isn't complex at all, there's barely a pretense for why they fall for each other, but it turns out great.</manga-component>

						>The best slice of life ever. Hands down. Bar none. It doesn't get any better than this. 

						I think the core of what this manga does so well is the way that it utilizes space. So many manga, slice of life or otherwise, feel this need to constantly have *something* going on, whether it's dialogue or action or what have you. But here, I'd say a good portion of this manga -- easily 25% of it -- is solely made up of quiet shots and interactions with minimal to no dialogue at all. It has this calming presence to it which is really hard to convey, but it pulls it off perfectly. I don't think there even is a more relaxing manga than this one. The art is also absolutely phenomenal, easily some of the best I've ever seen. Not because of its detail, but just how believable it all is. It's hard to properly explain, but it feels much closer to the style of real people while maintaining the manga style and not looking disconcerting. 

						It's a very comfortable story. There are ups and downs, everybody has their own worries... I mean, that's life. The romance is a bit discreet at first, with the only truly explicit romance showing up at the very end, but you can definitely see the love from the very beginning. I really just wish that there was more story and romance after the end! The girls' romance stories are just getting started at the end, and there are hints towards where it could have gone in the omake... I would ***die*** for a sequel. Even just a oneshot. The best way I can describe this manga is with a single word: comfortable. It's the best of the best for a reason. Give it a read.

						The biggest shame is that this author has written very few other works. There is a prequel/pilot for Our Wonderful Days called [The Other Side of a Blank Page](https://mangadex.org/title/f1cb8ebf-d00d-4a49-9eb0-1b70bf5e39bf/the-other-side-of-a-blank-page), and a oneshot in the Syrup Yuri Anthology which I can't find. If the author ever makes another work, I will die happy.</manga-component>
