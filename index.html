							Welcome to my website! My name is Stella, and I'm a hobbyist programmer in the linux desktop space. I'm also a [potter](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/potter) focusing in traditional Japanese aesthetics, my main focuses being form and glazes. I'm currently working on developing my own glaze recipes.

							I listen to all genres of music and bounce between them often. My favorite band is  [Last Dinosaurs](https://www.last.fm/music/Last+Dinosaurs), some others I enjoy being [Good Kid](https://www.last.fm/music/Good+Kid), [The Polar Boys](https://www.last.fm/music/The+Polar+Boys), [The Rare Occasions](https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rare+Occasions), and [Sarah and the Sundays](https://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+and+the+Sundays). I'd recommend that anyone listen to [Mint Jams](https://www.last.fm/music/Casiopea/MINT+JAMS(Live)), [All the Unknown](https://www.last.fm/music/Grandbrothers/All+the+Unknown), [The Living End](https://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+and+the+Sundays/The+Living+End), and [Wellness](https://www.last.fm/music/Last+Dinosaurs/Wellness).

							I read a lot of manga -- mainly light hearted romance -- and write reviews for a lot of them [here](https://star.is-a.dev/blog/manga). If you want to see what my favorites are, just sort by rating! Aside from that I read a variety of books. My current favorites are Ender's Game, The Electric State, and The Stone Gods, though I do read a lot for my studies and research. There are a wealth of excellent books for pottery theory and glaze research, and I'm slowly building up my own personal collection.

							Video games are a consistent part of my free time, usually relaxing games that you can turn your brain off for, but sometimes more competitive ones when I feel up for it. My favorites are (in no particular order) Team Fortress 2, Celeste, Terraria, Minecraft, Momodora, and Omori. Pokemon is also probably my favorite game series, though they definitely fell off after generation 7. Recently, since I've had far less free time than I used to, I've also started getting back into some "pick up and play" games that don't require much thinking or remembering where I left off like Animal Crossing.
