						# About

						Welcome to my website! My name is Stella, and I'm a hobbyist programmer in the linux desktop space. I'm also a [potter](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/potter) focusing in traditional Japanese aesthetics, my main focuses being form and glazes. I'm currently working on developing my own glaze recipes.

						I listen to all genres of music and bounce between them often. My favorite band is  [Last Dinosaurs](https://www.last.fm/music/Last+Dinosaurs), some others I enjoy being [Good Kid](https://www.last.fm/music/Good+Kid), [The Polar Boys](https://www.last.fm/music/The+Polar+Boys), [The Rare Occasions](https://www.last.fm/music/The+Rare+Occasions), and [Sarah and the Sundays](https://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+and+the+Sundays). I'd recommend that anyone listen to [Mint Jams](https://www.last.fm/music/Casiopea/MINT+JAMS(Live)), [All the Unknown](https://www.last.fm/music/Grandbrothers/All+the+Unknown), [The Living End](https://www.last.fm/music/Sarah+and+the+Sundays/The+Living+End), and [Wellness](https://www.last.fm/music/Last+Dinosaurs/Wellness).

						I read a lot of manga, mainly light hearted romance. Favorites are Bloom Into You, Our Wonderful Days, The Sheep Princess in Wolf's Clothing, and more. Aside from that I read a variety of books, my favorites being Ender's Game, The Electric State, and The Stone Gods.

						Video games are a consistent part of my free time, usually relaxing games that you can turn your brain off for, but sometimes more competitive ones when I feel up for it. My favorites are (in no particular order) Team Fortress 2, Celeste, Terraria, Minecraft, Momodora: RutM, Omori, and Stardew Valley.
